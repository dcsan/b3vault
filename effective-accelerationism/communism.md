## communism
Communism is a political and economic ideology that advocates for a classless, stateless society where the means of production are owned and controlled collectively by the community, rather than by individuals or the government. It is often seen as a potential solution to the issues of exploitation and inequality within capitalism, with the goal of creating a more equal and sustainable society.
