## postcapitalism
Postcapitalism is a term coined by Mark Fisher to describe a potential future system in which the traditional capitalist economic model has been replaced by alternative forms of production and distribution. This could include elements of automation, social ownership, and a focus on meeting human needs rather than profit.
