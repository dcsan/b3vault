overview: >-
  Effective accelerationism is a political and philosophical concept that
  advocates for the acceleration of societal and technological progress in order
  to bring about radical change and transformation. It is a form of radical
  politics that seeks to dismantle the existing systems of power and create a
  more equitable and just society through the harnessing of technology and the
  forces of capitalism.


  At its core, effective accelerationism is a rejection of traditional leftist
  ideas of gradual reform and gradualism. It argues that attempting to reform or
  work within the existing systems of power is inherently futile and will only
  serve to perpetuate and reinforce the oppressive structures of capitalism.
  Instead, effective accelerationism calls for a complete overhaul of the
  current systems, through the acceleration of technological advancements and
  the disruption of traditional social, economic, and political institutions.


  One of the key principles of effective accelerationism is the idea that
  capitalism and technology can be harnessed for the greater good and used to
  bring about radical change. This means embracing and accelerating the forces
  of capitalism and technological innovation, rather than trying to resist or
  slow them down. By embracing the rapid growth and change of these systems,
  effective accelerationism believes that it is possible to create a more
  equitable and just society, free from the constraints of traditional power
  structures.


  Another important aspect of effective accelerationism is the rejection
