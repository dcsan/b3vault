## financialization
Financialization refers to the increasing role and influence of financial markets, institutions, and instruments in the economy, often at the expense of traditional productive activities, leading to a focus on short-term profits and speculative investments. This has resulted in a shift in power and wealth towards the financial sector and a potential destabilization of the economy.
