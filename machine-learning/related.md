1. Feature engineering: The process of selecting and transforming relevant data features to improve the performance of a machine learning model.

2. Bias-variance tradeoff: The tradeoff between model complexity and generalization error, where an overly complex model may have low bias but high variance, leading to overfitting. 

3. Cross-validation: A technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model by partitioning the available data into training and testing sets, allowing for model validation on unseen data.
