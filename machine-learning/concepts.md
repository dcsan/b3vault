## concepts
1. Supervised learning: A type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset to make predictions on new, unlabeled data.

2. Unsupervised learning: A type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns and relationships in data without being given specific labels or outcomes to predict.

3. Reinforcement learning: A type of machine learning where the algorithm learns through trial and error and is rewarded or punished based on its actions, allowing it to improve its decision-making over time.
