## fish
Fish are a diverse group of aquatic animals that are found in almost all bodies of water, from the depths of the ocean to freshwater lakes and rivers. They are characterized by their streamlined, torpedo-shaped bodies, fins, and gills, which allow them to move and breathe in water. There are over 34,000 known species of fish, making them the largest group of vertebrates on Earth.

One of the key features of fish is their adaptation to life in water. Their streamlined bodies, along with their fins, allow them to move swiftly and efficiently through the water. The gills, located on the sides of their head, extract oxygen from the water, which is then circulated through their bloodstream. This enables fish to breathe underwater, unlike land animals who breathe air. Some fish, such as lungfish and mudskippers, have also evolved the ability to breathe air through their skin or specialized organs.

Fish also come in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and colors. Some, like the whale shark, can grow up to 40 feet in length, while others, like the dwarf goby, are only a few millimeters long. Some fish have brightly colored scales, while others have a more muted coloration for camouflage. The shape of a fish's
