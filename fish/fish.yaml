        Fish are a diverse group of aquatic animals that are found in almost all
        bodies of water, from the depths of the ocean to freshwater lakes and
        rivers. They are characterized by their streamlined, torpedo-shaped
        bodies, fins, and gills, which allow them to move and breathe in water.
        There are over 34,000 known species of fish, making them the largest
        group of vertebrates on Earth.


        One of the key features of fish is their adaptation to life in water.
        Their streamlined bodies, along with their fins, allow them to move
        swiftly and efficiently through the water. The gills, located on the
        sides of their head, extract oxygen from the water, which is then
        circulated through their bloodstream. This enables fish to breathe
        underwater, unlike land animals who breathe air. Some fish, such as
        lungfish and mudskippers, have also evolved the ability to breathe air
        through their skin or specialized organs.


        Fish also come in a wide range of sizes, shapes, and colors. Some, like
        the whale shark, can grow up to 40 feet in length, while others, like
        the dwarf goby, are only a few millimeters long. Some fish have brightly
        colored scales, while others have a more muted coloration for
        camouflage. The shape of a fish's
